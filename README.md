This is a deep CNN classification model to predict the healthy and diseased plants based on the yield that we obtained through the organic farming practices during the COVID'19 period in accordance to the UN sustainable goal - Zero Hunger. This also proves our farming practices and strategies were well efficient and thus samples served to be a good source for the new model that we've dveloped for particular species of plants we've used in the dataset.
