This is a deep CNN classification model to predict the healthy and diseased plants based on the yield that we obtained through the organic farming practices during the COVID'19 period in accordance to the internship theme based on UN sustainable development goal - Zero Hunger. This also proves our farming practices and strategies were efficient and thus samples (species of medicinal plants) served to be a good source for the ML model development.
